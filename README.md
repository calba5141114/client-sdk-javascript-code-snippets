# client-sdk-javascript-building-blocks

Repository for JavaScript building blocks for Nexmo Client SDK.

Building block code samples for NDP.

This is the repository for JavaScript building block code.

## Notes for Developers

The building block repos are submodules as far as NDP is concerned. If you want to update the building block code for Nexmo Client SDK the recommended way is to:

1. Create a branch from the master of this repo and make your changes.
2. Raise a PR with your proposed changes to this repo.
3. Add @tbedford as a reviewer at least, but ideally one other dev who can test the code. 
4. Get your changes reviewed. Approver does the merge.
5. @tbedford will make the required changes to NDP and merge your changes (if you have flagged him that you have made changes).

If you want to do the entire process yourself you can, but see @tbedford first on what is required.
